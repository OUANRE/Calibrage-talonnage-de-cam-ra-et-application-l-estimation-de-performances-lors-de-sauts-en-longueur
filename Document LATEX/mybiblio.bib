	abstract = {Camera calibration has always been an essential component of photogrammetric measurement, with self-calibration nowadays being an integral and routinely applied operation within photogrammetric triangulation, especially in high-accuracy close-range measurement. With the very rapid growth in adoption of off-the-shelf digital cameras for a host of new 3D measurement applications, however, there are many situations where the geometry of the image network will not support robust recovery of camera parameters via on-the-job calibration. For this reason, stand-alone camera calibration has again emerged as an important issue in close-range photogrammetry, and it also remains a topic of research interest in computer vision. This paper overviews the current approaches adopted for camera calibration in close-range photogrammetry and computer vision, and discusses operational aspects for self-calibration. Also, the results of camera calibrations using different algorithms are summarized. Finally, the impact of chromatic aberration on modelled radial distortion is touched upon to highlight the fact that there are still issues of research interest in the photogrammetric calibration of consumer-grade digital cameras.},

	abstract = {Distance estimation can be achieved by using active sensors or with the help of passive sensors such as cameras. The stereo vision system is generally composed of two cameras to mimic the human binocular vision. In this paper, a Python‐based algorithm is proposed to find the parameters of each camera, rectify the images, create the disparity maps and finally use these maps for distance measurements. Experiments using real‐time images, which were captured from our stereo vision system, of different obstacles positioned at multiple distances (60–200 cm) prove the effectiveness of the proposed program and show that the calculated distance to the obstacle is relatively accurate. The accuracy of distance measurement is up to 99.83\%. The processing time needed to calculate the distance between the obstacle and the cameras is less than 0.355 s.},

Either the camera or the planar pattern can be freely moved. The motion need not be known. Radial lens distortion is modeled. The proposed procedure consists of a closed-form solution, followed by a nonlinear reﬁnement based on the maximum likelihood criterion. Both computer simulation and real data have been used to test the proposed technique, and very good results have been obtained. Compared with classical techniques which use expensive equipment such as two or three orthogonal planes, the proposed technique is easy to use and ﬂexible. It advances 3D computer vision one step from laboratory environments to real world use. The corresponding software is available from the author’s Web page.},
