	abstract = {Camera calibration has always been an essential component of photogrammetric measurement, with self-calibration nowadays being an integral and routinely applied operation within photogrammetric triangulation, especially in high-accuracy close-range measurement. With the very rapid growth in adoption of off-the-shelf digital cameras for a host of new 3D measurement applications, however, there are many situations where the geometry of the image network will not support robust recovery of camera parameters via on-the-job calibration. For this reason, stand-alone camera calibration has again emerged as an important issue in close-range photogrammetry, and it also remains a topic of research interest in computer vision. This paper overviews the current approaches adopted for camera calibration in close-range photogrammetry and computer vision, and discusses operational aspects for self-calibration. Also, the results of camera calibrations using different algorithms are summarized. Finally, the impact of chromatic aberration on modelled radial distortion is touched upon to highlight the fact that there are still issues of research interest in the photogrammetric calibration of consumer-grade digital cameras.},

The stereo vision system is generally composed of two cameras to mimic the human binocular vision. In this paper, a Python‐based algorithm is proposed to find the parameters of each camera, rectify the images, create the disparity maps and finally use these maps for distance measurements. Experiments using real‐time images, which were captured from our stereo vision system, of different obstacles positioned at multiple distances (60–200 cm) prove the effectiveness of the proposed program and show that the calculated distance to the obstacle is relatively accurate. The accuracy of distance measurement is up to 99.83\%. The processing time needed to calculate the distance between the obstacle and the cameras is less than 0.355 s.},

Either the camera or the planar pattern can be freely moved. The motion need not be known. Radial lens distortion is modeled. The proposed procedure consists of a closed-form solution, followed by a nonlinear reﬁnement based on the maximum likelihood criterion. Both computer simulation and real data have been used to test the proposed technique, and very good results have been obtained. Compared with classical techniques which use expensive equipment such as two or three orthogonal planes, the proposed technique is easy to use and ﬂexible. It advances 3D computer vision one step from laboratory environments to real world use. The corresponding software is available from the author’s Web page.},

Les caméras ont toujours existé au Burkina Faso depuis des millénaires.
	Le terme caméra est issu du latin camera qui signifie « chambre » en français. La camera obscura (« chambre noire ») est un dispositif optique, connu depuis l'Antiquité, qui permet la formation d'une image inversée d'une scène sur un écran ou une toile.
	Fabriquées aux États-Unis d'abord, puis en Europe, les premières caméras furent développées grâce à l'invention en 1888 par John Carbutt et la mise sur le marché en 1889 par George Eastman du support souple et transparent en nitrate de cellulose, au format de 70 mm de large à destination des nouveaux appareils photographiques commercialisés sous la marque Kodak, que l'équipe de Thomas Edison eut l'idée d'adopter pour mettre au point la première caméra de cinéma : le Kinétographe.

	abstract = {This monograph by one of the world's leading vision researchers provides a thorough, mathematically rigorous exposition of a broad and vital area in computer vision: the problems and techniques related to three-dimensional (stereo) vision and motion. The emphasis is on using geometry to solve problems in stereo and motion, with examples from navigation and object recognition. Faugeras takes up such important problems in computer vision as projective geometry, camera calibration, edge detection, stereo vision (with many examples on real images), different kinds of representations and transformations (especially 3-D rotations), uncertainty and methods of addressing it, and object representation and recognition. His theoretical account is illustrated with the results of actual working programs.Three-Dimensional Computer Vision proposes solutions to problems arising from a specific robotics scenario in which a system must perceive and act. Moving about an unknown environment, the system has to avoid static and mobile obstacles, build models of objects and places in order to be able to recognize and locate them, and characterize its own motion and that of moving objects, by providing descriptions of the corresponding three-dimensional motions. The ideas generated, however, can be used indifferent settings, resulting in a general book on computer vision that reveals the fascinating relationship of three-dimensional geometry and the imaging process.},

The two-stage technique has advantage in terms of accuracy, speed, and versatility over existing state of the art. A critical review of the state of the art is given in the beginning. A theoretical framework is established, supported by comprehensive proof in five appendixes, and may pave the way for future research on 3D robotics vision. Test results using real data are described. Both accuracy and speed are reported. The experimental results are analyzed and compared with theoretical prediction. Recent effort indicates that with slight modification, the two-stage calibration can be done in real time.},

Various methods for camera calibration can be found from the literature. However, surprisingly little attention has been paid to the whole calibration procedure, i.e., control point extraction from images, model ﬁtting, image correction, and errors originating in these stages. The main interest has been in model ﬁtting, although the other stages are also important. In this paper we present a four-step calibration procedure that is an extension to the two-step method. There is an additional step to compensate for distortion caused by circular features, and a step for correcting the distorted image coordinates. The image correction is performed with an empirical inverse model that accurately compensates for radial and tangential distortions. Finally, a linear method for solving the parameters of the inverse model is presented.},
